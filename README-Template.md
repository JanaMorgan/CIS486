# Project 5 - Find My iPhone App Development Project

Students will complete their own "working model" of the Find iPhone app login screen on a browser. The purpose is to match styles and screenshots, mimic basic behaviors, create a "mobile-first" site, and improve the "session expiration" message.

## Design Approach

I first searched CodePen for a JavaScript template that would display an informational message to the user. After I found the ideal message prompt that used BootStrap, I edited the message contents and styling to satsify the previous session has expired message requirement outlined on the project description GitHub page. I then proceeded to build the webpage around the message prompt template I found on GitHub. I would describe my design approach as almost puzzle-like. I would take different pieces of code from CodePen, Stack Overflow, or GitHub, and I would integrate them stylistically into my webpage.
