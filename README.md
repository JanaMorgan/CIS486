# Project 6 - Closing Project

For this project you will develop a crisp, clean, and functional web page deployed on GitHub pages w/ReadMe.md of the page's behavior.  

Requirements:

DIRECTORY - single index page, filenames, logical directories. No spaces in filenames/directories. 

HTML - a full viewport (not full page) image (kind've like on https://bobikesbama.com) in grayscale or black&white, with an imported font and wording positioned on the lower-right side of the image. (Essentially this is a 'splash screen'). 

CSS - all styles in the css. viewport breakpoint functionality to change the image size when the viewport shrinks. Styles must have consistent and logical naming with proper use of class and id. 

JS - must use jQuery. some animation on load, an event listener to support some interaction with the user on the page. Example: Clicking on the wording makes it animate.  

All code sufficiently commented to be clear of how the page is supposed to work.

**additional requirments will be given on case-by-case per submisison.

## Design Approach

I first used the resource posted in the comments underneath the project information page. The resource was a CodePen that contained a template for a full viewport image (https://codepen.io/theiwaz/pen/vybjc). I then found a hamburger style menu that uses Javascript that I overlayed over the full viewport image along with a splash font in the lower-right part of the full viewport image. I also implemented a typing animation in the top right of the full viewport image that immerses the user in the overall theme of the webpage. The hamburger menu is interactable via a click event and it displays links that do not do anything.
